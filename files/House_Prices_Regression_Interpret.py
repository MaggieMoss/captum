# # Interpret regression models using Boston House Prices Dataset

# This notebook demonstrates how to apply `Captum` library on a regression model and understand important features, layers / neurons that contribute to the prediction. It compares a number of attribution algorithms from `Captum` library for a simple DNN model trained on a sub-sample of a well-known Boston house prices dataset.
# 
# Note that in order to be able to run this notebook successfully you need to install scikit-learn package in advance.

# ## Data loading and pre-processing

# Let's load boston house prices dataset and corresponding labels from scikit-learn library. 

# In[2]:


boston = load_boston()

# feature_names -> ['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT']
feature_names = boston.feature_names

X = boston.data

# In order to retain deterministic results, let's fix the seeds.

# Let's use 70% of our data for training and the remaining 30% for testing.

# In[4]:


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)


# # Data Exploration

# Let's visualize dependent variable vs each independent variable in a separate plot. Apart from that we will also perform a simple regression analysis and plot the fitted line in dashed, red color.

# In[5]:


fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows = 3, ncols=5, figsize=(30, 20))
for i, (ax, col) in enumerate(zip(axs.flat, feature_names)):
    x = X[:,i]
    pf = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
    p = np.poly1d(pf)

    ax.plot(x, y, 'o')
    ax.plot(x, p(x),"r--")

    ax.set_title(col + ' vs Prices')
    ax.set_xlabel(col)
    ax.set_ylabel('Prices')


# From the diagram above we can tell that some of the most influential features that are correlated with the output price are:   
#    - RM, the average numbers of rooms in the houses of the neighborhood.
#      If RM increases the house price increases too.
#    - LSTAT, the percentage of the house-owners in the neighborhood (lower class).
#      This variable is negatively correlated with the price. The lower the class the less likely is that the person will be able to afford an expensive house.
#    - PTRATIO, the pupil-teacher ratio by town.
#      If the pupil-teacher ratio increases then the house price decreases, resulting in a negative correlation between ptratio and house price.
#      
# These features are being identified as important also from others and can be found by an online search.

# # Comparing different attribution algorithms

This will help us to understand how similar or different the attribution scores assigned from different attribution algorithms are. Apart from that we will also compare attribution scores with the learned model weights.
# 
# It is important to note the we aggregate the attributions across the entire test dataset in order to retain a global view of feature importance. This, however, is not ideal since the attributions can cancel out each other when we aggregate then across multiple samples.

# The magnitudes of learned model weights tell us about the correlations between the dependent variable `Price` and each independent variable. Zero weight means no correlation whereas positive weights indicate positive correlations and negatives the opposite. Since the network has more than one layer these weights might not be directly correlated with the price.
# 
# From the plot above we can see that attribution algorithms sometimes disagree on assigning importance scores and that they are not always aligned with weights. However, we can still observe that the top important three features: `LSTAT`, `RM` and `PTRATIO` are also considered to be important based on both most attribution algorithms and the weight scores.
# 
# It is interesting to observe that the feature `B` has high positive attribution score based on some of the attribution algorithms. This can be related, for example, to the choice of the baseline. In this tutorial we use zero-valued baselines for all features, however if we were to choose those values more carefully for each feature the picture will change. Similar arguments apply also when the signs of the weights and attributions mismatches or when one algorithm assigns higher or lower attribution scores compare to the others.
# 
# In terms of least important features, we observe that `CHAS` and `RAD` are voted to be least important both based on most attribution algorithms and learned coefficients.
# 
# Another interesting observation is that both Integrated Gradients and DeepLift return similar attribution scores across all features. This is associated with the fact that although we have non-linearities in our model, their effects aren't significant and DeepLift is close to `(input - baselines) * gradients`. And because the gradients do not change significantly along the straight line from baseline to input, we observe similar situation with Integrated Gradients as well.

# ## Attributing to the layers and comparing with model weights

# Now let's beside attributing to the inputs of the model, also attribute to the layers of the model and understand which neurons appear to be more important.
# 
# In the cell below we will attribute to the inputs of the second linear layer of our model. Similar to the previous case, the attribution is performed on the test dataset.

# In[21]:


# Compute the attributions of the output with respect to the inputs of the fourth linear layer
lc = LayerConductance(model, model.lin4)

# shape: test_examples x size_hidden
lc_attr_test = lc.attribute(X_test, n_steps=100, attribute_to_layer_input=True)

# weights from forth linear layer
# shape: size_hidden4 x size_hidden3
lin4_weight = model.lin4.weight


# In the cell below we normalize and visualize the attributions and learned model weights for all 10 neurons in the fourth hidden layer. 
# The weights represent the weight matrix of the fourth linear layer. The attributions are computed with respect to the inputs of the fourth linear layer.

# It is interesting to observe that the weights and attribution scores are well aligned for all 10 neurons in the last layer. Meaning that the neurons with negative weights also have negative attribution scores and we can observe the same for the positive weights and attributions. 
# 
# We also observe that the neurons five and nine have very small attributions but relatively larger weights. Another interesting thing to observe is that the weights do not fluctuate much whereas attributions do fluctuate more relative to that and spike in Layer 4.
